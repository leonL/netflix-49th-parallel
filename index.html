        <h1 class='headline'>Netflix's 49th Parallel</h1>
        <h2 class="subheadline">In addition to a wider selection of new releases, the U.S. site also has a deeper back catalogue than the Canadian version.</h2>

        <p class="article-body">As might be expected, the American Netflix has substantially <a href="http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2015/01/22/the-list-netflix-doesnt-want-you-to-see-how-canada-really-stacks-up-to-us-version.html#">more, recent releases (if not better ones)</a> than its Canadian counterpart, but how do their respective back catalogues, their collections of older films, compare?</p>

        <p class="article-body">It turns out the U.S. one is bigger again, by roughly 1,300 films. That's assuming the year 2000 as the threshold between old and recent releases, a questionable definition given the average movie's shelf life. It requires a stretch of the imagination, perhaps, to consider <span class="film-title">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</span> (2000) a recent release, but for our present purpose, a generous interpretation of newness only underlines the point. If we tighten the threshold the older releases' share of the difference between the total size of the two catalogues quickly balloons well over 50%.</p>

        <div class='totals'>
            <h1 class='chart-title'>Older films make up about half the size disparity</h1>
            <h2 class='chart-title'>Titles available on Netflix as of Jan. 2015</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="article-body">The American back catalogue is not only more diverse, but also reaches further back in time, including two hundred plus titles from 'The Golden Age of Hollywood' (1930 - 1959), as well as a handful of foreign films that predate its rise, such as the silent <span class="film-title">Fant√¥mas</span> serials (1913).</p>

        <p class="article-body">The contrast is stark: while both back catalogues drop off sharply after the 90s, Canada's smaller one dwindles more rapidly, and barely extends as far back as the Second World War, releases from decades prior to the 80s accounting for less than one hundred available titles; albeit some of the vintages that turn up among them, like <span class="film-title">The Third Man</span> (1949) and <span class="film-title">The Great Escape</span> (1963), aren't available from the American site.</p>

        <div class='back-catalogue'>
            <h1 class='chart-title'>Canada's short past</h1>
            <h2 class='chart-title'>Netflix's back catalogue size by release decade as of Jan. 2015</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="article-body">Not surprisingly, Netflix's concentration is on recent releases, which is borne out by the data. A glance at the distribution of title counts by release year, for both catalogues, tells the story: Netflix bulks up on films made within the last two to three years, while paring down on titles as they age, the numbers falling so consistently with each year that you have to wonder to what extent it's a reflection of the audience's preference for newer films (even between older ones), or that of a curatorial logic handled by an algorithm.</p>

        <p class="article-body">Which of today's releases will continue to be available decade after decade is anyone's guess. Come to think of it, will we still be streaming movies and shows over Netflix a decade or more from now, and if not where will <span class='italic'>it</span> be catalogued?</p>
