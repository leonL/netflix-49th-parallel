        <h1 class='headline'>Netflix' 49th Parallel</h1>
        <h2 class="subheadline">In addition to more new releases, the U.S. site also has a deeper back catalogue than the Canadian version.</h2>

        <p class="article-body">As might be expected, Netflix in the U.S. has significantly <a href="http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2015/01/22/the-list-netflix-doesnt-want-you-to-see-how-canada-really-stacks-up-to-us-version.html#">more recent films (if not necessarily better ones)</a> than in Canada, but how do the two different back catalogues compare?</p>

        <p class="article-body">It turns out the one in the U.S. has more past titles by almost the same magnitude than it has more recent ones, and that's when you draw the line between past and recent at 15 years ago, quite far back in terms of the common shelf life of a movie. Categorizing <span class="film-title">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</span> (2000) for example, as a recent release seems questionable at best, but for our present purpose the somewhat loose definition only underlines the point.</p>

        <div class='totals'>
            <h1 class='chart-title'>The old 50/50</h1>
            <h2 class='chart-title'>Titles available on Netflix as of Jan. 2015</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="article-body">The American back catalogue is not only more diverse, but also reaches further back in time, including two hundred plus titles from "The Golden Age of Hollywood" (1930 - 1959), as well as a handful of foreign films that predate its rise, such as the silent <span class="film-title">Fant√¥mas</span> serials (1913).</p>

        <p class="article-body">The contrast is stark: while both back catalogues drop off sharply after the 90s, Canada's unltimately smaller one barely extends as far back as the Second World War, releases from decades prior to the 80s accounting for less than one hundred available titles, albeit some of the vintages that turn up among them, like <span class="film-title">The Third Man</span> (1949) and <span class="film-title">The Great Escape</span> (1963), aren't available from the American site.</p>

        <div class='back-catalogue'>
            <h1 class='chart-title'>Canada's short past</h1>
            <h2 class='chart-title'>Netflix' back catalogue size by release decade</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="article-body">Not suprisingly, Netflix' concentration is on recent releases, and the distribution of title counts by release year for both catalogues bear out as much. Netflix bulks up on films made within the last two to three years, while paring down on titles as they age. Which of today's releases will continue to be available decade after decade is anyone's guess, if we still even have Netflix a decade from now.</p>
